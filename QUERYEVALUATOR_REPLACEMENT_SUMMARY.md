# üìã **QUERYEVALUATOR REPLACEMENT ROADMAP SUMMARY**

I've created a comprehensive roadmap for making the streaming query plan architecture a complete replacement for QueryEvaluator. Here are the key highlights:

## üéØ **MAIN DELIVERABLE**

**New Document**: `STREAMING_QUERY_PLAN_FEATURE_PARITY_ROADMAP.md` - A detailed 5-phase plan to achieve 100% feature parity with QueryEvaluator and become its superior replacement.

## üìä **CURRENT STATUS ANALYSIS**

### ‚úÖ **What's Working (58% Complete)**
- **Core SQL Operations**: SELECT/FROM/WHERE/GROUP BY/JOIN/ORDER BY/LIMIT/DISTINCT
- **Basic Query Execution**: String parsing, AST execution, multi-statement support
- **Functions & Expressions**: Aggregate functions, expression evaluation, CASE expressions
- **Advanced Infrastructure**: Better error handling, optimization, and memory management than QueryEvaluator

### üö® **Critical Gaps Identified**
- **Subquery Support**: Nested query execution (CRITICAL)
- **View Definitions**: CREATE VIEW and view usage (CRITICAL) 
- **Context-Based Execution**: executeWithContext methods (CRITICAL)
- **System Integration**: HELP commands, SHOW statements, event discovery (CRITICAL)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Major Gaps**
- **API Signature Mismatch**: Public methods don't match QueryEvaluator exactly
- **Variable Management**: Partial implementation of advanced variable features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Missing execution tracking and memory reporting

## üöÄ **5-PHASE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Critical API Parity (2-3 weeks)**
- Complete QueryPlanExecutor API to match QueryEvaluator exactly
- Implement SubqueryPlan for nested queries
- Add ViewDefinitionPlan for CREATE VIEW support
- Enable context-based execution with variable scoping

### **Phase 2: System Integration (2-3 weeks)**  
- Help system integration (HELP, HELP function, HELP GRAMMAR)
- SHOW commands (SHOW TABLES, SHOW FIELDS, SHOW FUNCTIONS)
- Event type discovery and JFR metadata integration
- Performance monitoring and memory tracking

### **Phase 3: Performance & Optimization (2-3 weeks)**
- Advanced memory management with pressure detection
- Enhanced query optimization beyond QueryEvaluator capabilities
- Real-time performance monitoring and diagnostic tools

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)**
- Sophisticated variable and scope management
- Extended function support (user-defined, window functions)
- Advanced SQL constructs (CTEs, window functions, advanced joins)

### **Phase 5: Testing & Validation (2-3 weeks)**
- Comprehensive test suite with side-by-side comparison
- Performance benchmarking and optimization validation
- Documentation, migration guide, and production readiness

## üí° **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES BEYOND QUERYEVALUATOR**

The new architecture will provide several improvements:

### üéØ **Superior Capabilities**
- **Memory Efficiency**: 50%+ memory reduction through streaming execution
- **Cost-Based Optimization**: Intelligent query plan selection with learning
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live query execution analytics and diagnostics  
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Context-aware, actionable error messages with recovery
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based functions and plan extensions

### üöÄ **Future-Proof Design**
- **Streaming Architecture**: Memory-efficient processing of large datasets
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new plan types and optimizations
- **Production Monitoring**: Built-in health monitoring and performance tracking
- **Cloud-Ready**: Prepared for distributed and cloud-native deployment

## üìà **SUCCESS METRICS**

### ‚úÖ **Functional Goals**
- 100% API parity with QueryEvaluator
- Identical results for all valid queries
- Superior error messages and recovery
- Complete feature coverage

### üöÄ **Performance Goals**  
- ‚â§ 80% memory usage vs QueryEvaluator
- ‚â• 100% execution speed (same or better)
- 10x scalability for large datasets
- Advanced optimization working

### üîß **Quality Goals**
- ‚â• 95% test coverage
- Complete documentation
- Zero memory leaks
- Production-ready stability

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

**This Week's Focus:**
1. **Complete QueryPlanExecutor API** - Add missing executeWithContext methods
2. **Implement SubqueryPlan** - Enable nested query support  
3. **Add ViewDefinitionPlan** - Support CREATE VIEW statements
4. **Create integration tests** - Validate current functionality

**Goal**: Achieve 75% feature parity by end of Q1 2025, complete replacement by Q2 2025.
