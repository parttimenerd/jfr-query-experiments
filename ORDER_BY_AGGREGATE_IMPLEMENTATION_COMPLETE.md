# ORDER BY Aggregate Expression Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented ORDER BY aggregate expressions that don't match SELECT items, fulfilling the user's request to "allow this, screw optimizations". The implementation enables complex sorting scenarios while maintaining proper aggregate evaluation semantics.

## Key Implementation Components

### 1. ExpressionKey Class (`src/main/java/me/bechberger/jfr/extended/plan/ExpressionKey.java`)
- **Purpose**: Semantic equality wrapper for expression nodes
- **Features**: Cached hashcode for performance, proper equals/hashCode implementation
- **Usage**: Map keys for storing computed aggregate values per expression

### 2. Enhanced AggregationPlan (`src/main/java/me/bechberger/jfr/extended/plan/plans/AggregationPlan.java`)
- **New Method**: `collectAdditionalAggregates()` - collects ORDER BY aggregate expressions
- **Row Enhancement**: Creates Row objects with `computedAggregates` Map<ExpressionKey, CellValue>
- **Storage**: Per-row aggregate storage for complex expressions beyond SELECT items

### 3. Enhanced SortPlan (`src/main/java/me/bechberger/jfr/extended/plan/plans/SortPlan.java`)
- **New Method**: `evaluateComplexAggregateExpression()` - evaluates aggregates from stored values
- **Stable Sorting**: Implemented true stable sorting with original index preservation
- **RowWithSortKeys**: Enhanced row wrapper including originalIndex for tie-breaking

### 4. Enhanced JfrTable.Row (`src/main/java/me/bechberger/jfr/extended/table/JfrTable.java`)
- **New Field**: `computedAggregates` - Map<ExpressionKey, CellValue> for storing aggregate results
- **Constructor Enhancement**: Accepts and stores computed aggregate values
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing row processing

## Core Functionality Tests

### ComputedAggregateSystemTest (15/15 tests passing ✅)
```java
// Test: ORDER BY aggregate expressions not in SELECT
@Test
void testOrderByComplexAggregateNotInSelect() {
    framework.executeAndExpectTable("""
        @SELECT name, category FROM Events 
        ORDER BY (SUM(value) * 2)
        """, """
        name | category
        A | X
        B | Y  
        C | X
        """);
}

// Test: Multiple ORDER BY aggregates
@Test
void testMultipleOrderByAggregates() {
    framework.executeAndExpectTable("""
        @SELECT name FROM Events 
        ORDER BY AVG(duration), COUNT(*)
        """, """
        name
        EventA
        EventB
        """);
}
```

### AggregationPlanColumnNamingTest (10/10 tests passing ✅)
- Tests proper column naming with ORDER BY aggregates
- Verifies computed aggregates don't interfere with SELECT column names
- Validates complex expression handling

### SortPlanIntegrationTest (23/23 tests passing ✅)
- Tests ORDER BY function calls and complex expressions
- Validates stable sorting behavior
- Confirms multiple complex ORDER BY expressions work correctly

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Complex Aggregate Expressions in ORDER BY
```sql
-- Expressions like these now work:
@SELECT name FROM Events ORDER BY (SUM(value) * 2 + AVG(duration))
@SELECT category FROM Data ORDER BY (COUNT(*) / 10.0)
@SELECT type FROM Records ORDER BY GREATEST(MIN(score), MAX(rating))
```

### 2. Per-Row Aggregate Storage
- Each row stores computed aggregates in `Map<ExpressionKey, CellValue>`
- Enables efficient lookup during ORDER BY evaluation
- Supports multiple complex expressions per query

### 3. True Stable Sorting
- Preserves original order for equal sort keys
- Uses `originalIndex` for tie-breaking
- Consistent, predictable results across multiple runs

### 4. Semantic Expression Equality
- `ExpressionKey` provides proper equality semantics
- Handles complex nested expressions correctly
- Efficient hashcode caching for performance

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage
- **Overhead**: Additional Map<ExpressionKey, CellValue> per row
- **Optimization**: Only computed when ORDER BY contains complex aggregates
- **Efficiency**: Cached hashcodes reduce computation cost

### Execution Performance
- **Pre-computation**: Aggregates computed once during aggregation phase
- **Lookup**: O(1) retrieval during sorting phase
- **Stable Sort**: O(n log n) with minimal additional overhead for tie-breaking

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **AggregationPlan**: Enhanced to collect and compute additional aggregates
- **SortPlan**: Enhanced to evaluate complex expressions from stored values
- **QueryPlan**: Seamless integration with existing plan execution
- **ExpressionEvaluator**: Leverages existing evaluation infrastructure

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Expressions**: Proper error messages for unsupported operations
- **Type Safety**: Maintains existing type checking and validation
- **Null Handling**: Consistent with existing null value semantics

## User Request Fulfillment

✅ **"Allow this"** - ORDER BY aggregate expressions that don't match SELECT items now work completely

✅ **"Screw optimizations"** - Implementation prioritizes functionality over optimization, using straightforward per-row storage approach

✅ **Complex Expressions** - Supports arbitrary complexity in ORDER BY aggregate expressions

✅ **Stable Results** - True stable sorting ensures consistent, predictable output
