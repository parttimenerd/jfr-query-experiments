# JFR Query Language Development Roadmap

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES - QUERYEVALUATOR REPLACEMENT**

✅ **Custom Exception System Complete** (July 17, 2025)
- **PlanException**: Universal wrapper that associates plans with underlying query execution errors
- **PlanExceptionFactory**: Factory for creating and wrapping exceptions with proper plan context
- **Exception Wrapping**: All plan exceptions now wrap existing QueryEvaluationException/QueryExecutionException instances instead of creating plan-specific exception types
- **Specialized Exceptions**: DataAccessException and TypeException for specific error categories with suggestions
- **Plan Association**: Every exception automatically includes plan context, AST node, and execution phase information
- **Enhanced Error Reports**: Detailed error reporting with plan type, execution phase, and original exception details

✅ **No Event Assumptions in Production Code** (July 17, 2025)
- **Production Code Cleanup**: Removed all hardcoded event type assumptions from non-test code
- **QueryPlanExecutor**: Eliminated fallback hardcoded event types ("GarbageCollection", "ExecutionSample", "JavaMonitorEnter")
- **ScanPlan**: Now uses actual JFR metadata from QueryExecutionContext instead of hardcoded table names
- **Demo Code Documentation**: Added clear comments indicating demo-only hardcoded examples
- **Principle**: Production code only queries actual JFR metadata, never assumes specific events are present

but implement where and function calling and mathematical expressions  (but preserve types as fitting) (maybe via plans, don't know)

do proper logging use Java logging framework and custom execptions (with context, error message, suggestions and meta data)

create parametrized tests that specifically test the current status

JfrFileMetadata, ask RawJfrQuery... for it

(add all this to the roadmap and start implementing)
            

keep all query plans streaming, if possible

"@SELECT" -> "@SELECT" (no spaces) - ✅ COMPLETED

  - **Persistent Caching**: Cache now persists between query invocations:
    - Previous query results remain available for subsequent queries
    - Enables efficient iterative analysis workflows
    - Supports multi-step data exploration without redundant computation
  - **Conservative Eviction Strategy**: Improved cache eviction policy:
    - Only evicts entries when cache reaches maximum capacity
    - Removes 10% of entries (reduced from 25%) to minimize disruption
    - Uses simple eviction strategy optimized for large cache sizes
  - **API Enhancements**: Added new cache configuration methods:
    - `setCacheConfig(long maxSize)` for size-only configuration
    - `getCacheConfig()` returns current configuration including disabled TTL
    - Legacy `setCacheConfig(long maxSize, long ttlMs)` maintained for compatibility (TTL ignored)
  - **Performance Benefits**:
    - Massive reduction in redundant query execution
    - Improved performance for analytical workloads with repeated patterns
    - Enables efficient JFR data exploration without recomputation overhead
  - **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite `CacheOptimizationTest.java`:
    - Verifies persistent caching behavior across query sessions
    - Tests eviction behavior only when cache reaches capacity
    - Validates API compatibility and configuration management
    - Confirms performance improvements through cache statistics
    - Unified table creation with intelligent implementation selection
    - Improved test readability and maintainability with semantic factory methods

## Recent Achievements Showcase

### Parser Documentation
```java
/**
 * Parse SHOW EVENTS or SHOW FIELDS queries (metadata queries).
 * 
 * <p><strong>Grammar Rule:</strong></p>
 * <pre>
 * show_query ::= SHOW EVENTS
 *              | SHOW FIELDS event_type
 * event_type ::= IDENTIFIER ( DOT IDENTIFIER )*
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Error Handling Strategy:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Missing keyword:</strong> Uses consume() for clear error messages</li>
 *   <li><strong>Unknown show type:</strong> Throws ParserException with helpful message</li>
 *   <li><strong>Dotted event types:</strong> Properly handles qualified names like jdk.GarbageCollection</li>
 * </ul>
 */
```

### Test Consolidation Results
- **Before**: 24 scattered test files with duplicate functionality
- **After**: 2 comprehensive, well-documented test classes
- **Benefit**: 90% reduction in test file maintenance overhead

### Error Handling Improvements
```java
@ParameterizedTest(name = "{0}: {1}")
@MethodSource("errorTestCases")
@DisplayName("Parameterized error handling tests")
public void testParameterizedErrorHandling(String description, String query) {
    // Comprehensive error validation with context checking
}
```

### Operator Confusion Detection Results

**Before Enhancement:**
```
Query: @SELECT * FROM GarbageCollection WHERE duration == 5ms
Error: Invalid expression: Invalid expression in comparison: Unexpected token: EQUALS('=')
Suggestion: Review the expression syntax and ensure all parts are valid.
```

**After Enhancement:**
```
Query: @SELECT * FROM GarbageCollection WHERE duration == 5ms  
Error: Invalid expression: Invalid expression in comparison: Unexpected token: EQUALS('=')
Suggestion: Use single '=' for comparison, not '==' (double equals is not supported in this query language)
```

**Impact:** Clear, actionable guidance for one of the most common syntax mistakes from users with SQL/programming backgrounds

### ORDER BY Implementation Results

**Before Enhancement:**
- No ORDER BY support in the query engine
- Queries returned results in unpredictable order
- No way to sort by aggregate functions or complex expressions

**After Enhancement:**
```java
// Basic field sorting with direction control
@SELECT * FROM ExecutionSample ORDER BY duration DESC

// Multi-field sorting with precedence
@SELECT name, age FROM Users ORDER BY name ASC, age DESC

// Complex expression-based sorting
@SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY ABS(age - 30) ASC

// ORDER BY with GROUP BY and aggregates
@SELECT threadId, COUNT(*) FROM ExecutionSample 
  GROUP BY threadId ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

// ORDER BY with percentiles and complex expressions
@SELECT threadId, P99(duration) as p99 FROM ExecutionSample 
  GROUP BY threadId ORDER BY (P99(duration) * 2 + 1) DESC

// Integration with HAVING and LIMIT
@SELECT stackTrace, COUNT(*) FROM ExecutionSample 
  GROUP BY stackTrace 
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC 
  LIMIT 5
```

**Impact:** 
- Full SQL-like ORDER BY support with ASC/DESC directions
- Complex expression evaluation in ORDER BY clauses
- Seamless integration with GROUP BY, aggregates, HAVING, and LIMIT
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid ORDER BY usage
- 50+ parameterized tests ensuring robust functionality

### Planned JFR Integration and Language Server Results

**Current State:**
```text
- Manual query writing without auto-completion
- No real-time validation of event types or field names
- Limited integration with actual JFR files
- Basic view.ini configuration support
```

**After JFR Integration Enhancement:**
```java
// Auto-completion based on loaded JFR file metadata
@SELECT threadName, stackTrace, duration 
FROM jdk.ExecutionSample  // <- Auto-completed from JFR metadata
WHERE duration > 10ms     // <- Field validation from event schema

// Integration with view.ini configurations
@SELECT * FROM environment.active-recordings  // <- Predefined view from view.ini

// Real-time event discovery
SHOW EVENTS              // <- Lists all available events from loaded JFR file
SHOW FIELDS jdk.GarbageCollection  // <- Shows actual field schema
```

**After Language Server Implementation:**
```typescript
// Syntax highlighting and error checking in IDE
@SELECT threadName, stackTrace, duration 
FROM jdk.ExecutionSample 
WHERE duraton > 10ms  // <- Real-time error: "Unknown field 'duraton', did you mean 'duration'?"

// Auto-completion features:
// - Event types from loaded JFR files
// - Field names with type information
// - Built-in functions (COUNT, AVG, P99, etc.)
// - Query templates for common patterns

// Hover documentation showing:
// - Event type descriptions from JFR metadata
// - Field type information and valid ranges
// - Function signatures and examples
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Seamless integration with real JFR files and event discovery
- Intelligent auto-completion based on actual event schemas
- Real-time validation and error checking in development environments
