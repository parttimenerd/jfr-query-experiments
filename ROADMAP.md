## Recent Achievements Showcase

### Parser Documentation
```java
/**
 * Parse SHOW EVENTS or SHOW FIELDS queries (metadata queries).
 * 
 * <p><strong>Grammar Rule:</strong></p>
 * <pre>
 * show_query ::= SHOW EVENTS
 *              | SHOW FIELDS event_type
 * event_type ::= IDENTIFIER ( DOT IDENTIFIER )*
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Error Handling Strategy:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Missing keyword:</strong> Uses consume() for clear error messages</li>
 *   <li><strong>Unknown show type:</strong> Throws ParserException with helpful message</li>
 *   <li><strong>Dotted event types:</strong> Properly handles qualified names like jdk.GarbageCollection</li>
 * </ul>
 */
```

### Test Consolidation Results
- **Before**: 24 scattered test files with duplicate functionality
- **After**: 2 comprehensive, well-documented test classes
- **Benefit**: 90% reduction in test file maintenance overhead

### Error Handling Improvements
```java
@ParameterizedTest(name = "{0}: {1}")
@MethodSource("errorTestCases")
@DisplayName("Parameterized error handling tests")
public void testParameterizedErrorHandling(String description, String query) {
    // Comprehensive error validation with context checking
}
```

### Operator Confusion Detection Results

**Before Enhancement:**
```
Query: @SELECT * FROM GarbageCollection WHERE duration == 5ms
Error: Invalid expression: Invalid expression in comparison: Unexpected token: EQUALS('=')
Suggestion: Review the expression syntax and ensure all parts are valid.
```

**After Enhancement:**
```
Query: @SELECT * FROM GarbageCollection WHERE duration == 5ms  
Error: Invalid expression: Invalid expression in comparison: Unexpected token: EQUALS('=')
Suggestion: Use single '=' for comparison, not '==' (double equals is not supported in this query language)
```

**Impact:** Clear, actionable guidance for one of the most common syntax mistakes from users with SQL/programming backgrounds

### ORDER BY Implementation Results

**Before Enhancement:**
- No ORDER BY support in the query engine
- Queries returned results in unpredictable order
- No way to sort by aggregate functions or complex expressions

**After Enhancement:**
```java
// Basic field sorting with direction control
@ SELECT * FROM ExecutionSample ORDER BY duration DESC

// Multi-field sorting with precedence
@ SELECT name, age FROM Users ORDER BY name ASC, age DESC

// Complex expression-based sorting
@ SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY ABS(age - 30) ASC

// ORDER BY with GROUP BY and aggregates
@ SELECT threadId, COUNT(*) FROM ExecutionSample 
  GROUP BY threadId ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

// ORDER BY with percentiles and complex expressions
@ SELECT threadId, P99(duration) as p99 FROM ExecutionSample 
  GROUP BY threadId ORDER BY (P99(duration) * 2 + 1) DESC

// Integration with HAVING and LIMIT
@ SELECT stackTrace, COUNT(*) FROM ExecutionSample 
  GROUP BY stackTrace 
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC 
  LIMIT 5
```

**Impact:** 
- Full SQL-like ORDER BY support with ASC/DESC directions
- Complex expression evaluation in ORDER BY clauses
- Seamless integration with GROUP BY, aggregates, HAVING, and LIMIT
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid ORDER BY usage
- 50+ parameterized tests ensuring robust functionality

### Planned JFR Integration and Language Server Results

**Current State:**
```text
- Manual query writing without auto-completion
- No real-time validation of event types or field names
- Limited integration with actual JFR files
- Basic view.ini configuration support
```

**After JFR Integration Enhancement:**
```java
// Auto-completion based on loaded JFR file metadata
@SELECT threadName, stackTrace, duration 
FROM jdk.ExecutionSample  // <- Auto-completed from JFR metadata
WHERE duration > 10ms     // <- Field validation from event schema

// Integration with view.ini configurations
@SELECT * FROM environment.active-recordings  // <- Predefined view from view.ini

// Real-time event discovery
SHOW EVENTS              // <- Lists all available events from loaded JFR file
SHOW FIELDS jdk.GarbageCollection  // <- Shows actual field schema
```

**After Language Server Implementation:**
```typescript
// Syntax highlighting and error checking in IDE
@SELECT threadName, stackTrace, duration 
FROM jdk.ExecutionSample 
WHERE duraton > 10ms  // <- Real-time error: "Unknown field 'duraton', did you mean 'duration'?"

// Auto-completion features:
// - Event types from loaded JFR files
// - Field names with type information
// - Built-in functions (COUNT, AVG, P99, etc.)
// - Query templates for common patterns

// Hover documentation showing:
// - Event type descriptions from JFR metadata
// - Field type information and valid ranges
// - Function signatures and examples
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Seamless integration with real JFR files and event discovery
- Intelligent auto-completion based on actual event schemas
- Real-time validation and error checking in development environments  
- Reduced query development time through IDE integration
- Enhanced developer experience with rich language support
