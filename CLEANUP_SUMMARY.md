# Query Engine Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Cleaned up QueryEvaluatorUtils, ExpressionEvaluator, and ExecutionContext classes to improve code quality and remove unused code.

## Changes Made

### QueryEvaluatorUtils.java
- **Fixed duplicate `isNumericValue` method**: Removed the duplicate method that had incomplete switch statement logic
- **Fixed `isNumericColumn` method**: Completed the switch statement to properly handle all numeric cell types (NUMBER, DURATION, TIMESTAMP, MEMORY_SIZE, RATE)
- **Improved type safety**: Consolidated numeric type checking logic

### ExpressionEvaluator.java  
- **Removed debug statements**: Cleaned up debug print statements that were cluttering the code
- **Simplified constructor pattern**: Consolidated three constructors into two, using constructor chaining for better maintainability
- **Improved error handling**: Removed verbose debug logging in favor of cleaner error reporting

### Exception Cleanup
- **Removed unused exception**: Deleted `VariableNotFoundException.java` as it was not being used anywhere in the codebase

## ExecutionContext.java
- **Verified clean state**: This class was already well-structured with proper separation of concerns
- **Cache functionality**: Retained all caching and variable management functionality as it's actively used
- **No changes needed**: The class structure and methods are all being used appropriately

## Impact
- **Reduced code complexity**: Eliminated duplicate and dead code
- **Improved maintainability**: Simplified constructor patterns and removed debug clutter
- **Better type safety**: Fixed incomplete switch statements and type checking logic
- **Cleaner error handling**: Removed verbose debug statements while preserving error information

## Files Modified
1. `/src/main/java/me/bechberger/jfr/extended/engine/QueryEvaluatorUtils.java`
2. `/src/main/java/me/bechberger/jfr/extended/engine/ExpressionEvaluator.java`
3. **Deleted**: `/src/main/java/me/bechberger/jfr/extended/engine/exception/VariableNotFoundException.java`

## Verification
All core functionality remains intact:
- Aggregate function detection and evaluation
- Expression evaluation in row context  
- Variable and execution context management
- Exception handling for plan execution errors
- Caching and lazy evaluation features

The cleanup focused on removing redundant code and improving code quality without breaking existing functionality.
