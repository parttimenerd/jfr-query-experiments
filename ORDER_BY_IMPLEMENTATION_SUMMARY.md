# ORDER BY and Column Naming Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive ORDER BY support and enhanced column naming for anonymous expressions in the JFR Query Engine.

## 1. SortPlan Analysis and Verification
✅ **Already Complete**: SortPlan was discovered to already support all requested features:
- **DESC/ASC Support**: Full ascending and descending sort capabilities
- **Arbitrary Expressions**: Support for complex expressions as sort keys
- **Multi-field Sorting**: Multiple sort criteria with mixed ASC/DESC
- **Function Integration**: Sort by function results (ABS, SQRT, etc.)

### Key SortPlan Features Verified:
- `createMultiFieldComparator()` for multi-field sorting
- `evaluateOrderByExpression()` for expression evaluation
- Proper null handling and error management
- Integration with PlanExpressionEvaluator

## 2. Column Naming Enhancement
✅ **Completed**: Enhanced column naming for anonymous expressions in both plans
- **AggregationPlan**: Anonymous expressions named as `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- **ProjectionPlan**: Anonymous expressions named as `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- **Consistency**: Both plans now use 0-based indexing for anonymous columns

### Changes Made:
```java
// AggregationPlan - Updated method signature to include column index
private String extractColumnName(ExpressionNode expr, int columnIndex) {
    // ... existing logic for named expressions ...
    
    // For anonymous expressions, use column index
    return "$" + columnIndex;
}

// ProjectionPlan - Changed from 1-based to 0-based column numbering
private String getColumnName(SelectItemNode field, int columnNumber) {
    // ... existing logic for named expressions ...
    
    // For expressions, use column number (0-based)
    return "$" + columnNumber;
}
```

### Query Examples:
```sql
-- Simple expressions
@SELECT duration + 2 FROM Events
-- Results in column: $0

-- Multiple expressions
@SELECT duration + 2, duration * 2, name FROM Events  
-- Results in columns: $0, $1, name

-- With aliases
@SELECT duration + 2 as increased, duration * 2 as doubled FROM Events
-- Results in columns: increased, doubled
```

## 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
✅ **Created**: SortPlanIntegrationTest with 25+ test methods covering:

### Test Categories:
- **Basic Sorting**: Simple ASC/DESC on single fields
- **Multi-field Sorting**: Multiple sort criteria with mixed directions
- **Expression Sorting**: Complex expressions as sort keys
- **Function Sorting**: Mathematical functions in ORDER BY
- **Integration Tests**: Full query validation with executeAndExpectTable
- **Error Handling**: Invalid expressions and edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset sorting validation

### Test Framework Integration:
- Uses QueryTestFramework.executeAndExpectTable pattern
- Mock table setup for consistent testing
- Proper result validation and error checking

## 4. Column Naming Test Suite
✅ **Created**: AggregationPlanColumnNamingTest validating:
- Anonymous expressions named as `$0`, `$1`, `$2`
- Mixed named and anonymous columns
- Function call name retention
- Field access name retention
- Complex expressions with aliases

## 5. Architecture Benefits
- **Streaming Implementation**: SortPlan uses efficient streaming architecture
- **Memory Management**: Proper handling of large datasets
- **Expression Evaluation**: Integrated with PlanExpressionEvaluator
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Test Coverage**: Extensive integration testing

## 6. File Summary
### Created Files:
1. `SortPlanIntegrationTest.java` - 294 lines, 25+ test methods
2. `AggregationPlanColumnNamingTest.java` - 200+ lines, 9 test methods
3. `ProjectionPlanColumnNamingTest.java` - 150+ lines, 7 test methods
4. `SimpleColumnNamingTest.java` - 80+ lines, 3 test methods

### Modified Files:
1. `AggregationPlan.java` - Enhanced extractColumnName method
2. `ProjectionPlan.java` - Changed to 0-based column numbering

## 7. Query Support Examples
The implementation now fully supports queries like:
```sql
-- Basic sorting
@SELECT * FROM Events ORDER BY timestamp ASC

-- Multi-field sorting
@SELECT * FROM Events ORDER BY priority DESC, timestamp ASC

-- Expression sorting
@SELECT * FROM Events ORDER BY duration * 1000 DESC

-- Function sorting
@SELECT * FROM Events ORDER BY ABS(value - 50) ASC

-- Anonymous column naming
@SELECT value + 5, value * 2, category FROM Events
-- Results in columns: $0, $1, category
```

## 8. Implementation Status
✅ **Complete**: All requested features implemented and tested
✅ **Verified**: SortPlan supports DESC/ASC and arbitrary expressions
✅ **Enhanced**: AggregationPlan uses $N naming for anonymous columns
✅ **Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with executeAndExpectTable
✅ **Integrated**: Full integration with QueryTestFramework

The JFR Query Engine now has robust ORDER BY support with comprehensive testing and improved column naming for anonymous expressions.
